2048 Game with GUI

Has a slight glitch that bamboozles the player (or not).
Can be helpful or not but main reason I built this was to train myself with Java GUI coding, so not worried about this.

Also slightly unfinished, I might revisit this in the future but as of right now I don't really want to spend more than a day in these little projects of mine.
